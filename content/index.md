Title: Systems Development for Computational Science

## <span style="color:#ff0000">Â¡This is a draft 08-30-2023! </span>
Computation has emerged as the third pillar of science alongside the pillars of
theory and experiment.  Computational science is maturing rapidly and has found
considerable and significant use in supporting scientists from various
disciplines (including all engineering disciplines, mathematics, physics,
chemistry, finance, biology, and data analysis to name a few).  Many burgeoning
scientists are still taught to write "a code" for some problem and to debug when
things look wrong. Given the ever-increasing complexity of software solutions to
scientific problems, this old paradigm is no longer tenable and at best
inefficient.

CS107/AC207 is an applications course highlighting the use of software
engineering and computer science in solving scientific problems. You will learn
the fundamentals of developing scientific software systems including abstract
thinking, the handling of data, and assessment of computational approaches: all
in the context of good software engineering practices.

## <a id="important"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#important">Important Information</a>

* **Canvas:** Is used for posting grades and other sensitive content.  The class
  can be found on Canvas at this link
  <https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/122565>
* **Class `git` repository:** All handouts in CS107/AC207 are provided through
  the `main` repository hosted in the CS107 organization at
  <https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/main>.  You can set this repository as an
  upstream in your private class repository or clone it once you have joined the
  CS107 organization

```bash
git clone git@code.harvard.edu:CS107/main.git
```

  Updates to the `main` repository are posted on the class mailing list. Your
  Harvard ID is required to login to <https://code.harvard.edu>. You can request
  membership in the CS107 organization (AC207 students join the CS107
  organization as well) by sending an email to
  `cs107-staff@g.harvard.edu` (using your `.harvard.edu` email).  You
  must include your
  [NetID](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&sys_id=507aca5a1b653700efd8a79b2d4bcb59)
  in the body of your email, which is also your <https://code.harvard.edu>
  username (something similar to `abc123`).

  > **Once you have been added to the CS107 organization, create your own
  > private repository _inside the organization.  Your private repository must
  > have the exact name as your NetID_.** This will be your private class
  > repository where you submit your homework and pair-programming exercises.

 email with a blank message to complete the subscription.*


### <a id="staff-mailinglist"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#staff-mailinglist">Teaching Staff Mailing List</a>

You can reach the teaching staff directly by sending your email to the following
mailing list

> _(email sent to this list is only seen by the teaching staff; only email
> ending with **`.harvard.edu`** is accepted)_

You are not required to register for this mailing list **but only** email
addresses ending with `.harvard.edu` are accepted (you will receive a rejection
message otherwise).


### <a id="checklist"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#checklist">Getting Started Checklist</a>

* Sign up with the CS107 organization on <https://code.harvard.edu/CS107> and
  <a href="./tutorials.html#tutorial-repo">create your own private repository
  inside the organization</a>.
* Information flow:
    + Canvas &#8594; Grades and discussion forum
    + <https://code.harvard.edu/CS107>
         - Assignment submissions **inside your private repository** (homework,
           pair-programming exercises)
         - Group repositories for project work
         - All course handouts are published in the
           <https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/main> repository
* Need help? &#8594; `cs107-staff@g.harvard.edu`
* **OPTIONAL:**
    + Sign up on the [class mailing list](./#class-mailinglist) to receive push
      notifications when new content is available in the
      <https://code.harvard.edu/CS107/main> class repository.
    + You can get an Ubuntu `docker` container with the necessary class tools by
      `docker pull iacs/cs107_ubuntu`. Note that **no** `ssh` keys are contained
      in that image for use with `git`.  See also the <a
      href="./pages/resources.html#docker">docker resources page</a>.
