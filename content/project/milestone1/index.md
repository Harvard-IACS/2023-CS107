You will now begin your final project to develop a Python package for astronomical research. Please get together with your project group and complete the tasks below for Milestone 1.

## Steps to complete

1. Find team members you would like to work with and establish a way to communicate.
2. Register your team on Canvas. Send an email to `cs107-staff@g.harvard.edu` with your team number and members. You should also create your team name, which will be used to represent your team.
3. Your team ID will be `team01` if you are `Project - Group # 1` or `team10` if you are `Project - Group # 10` and so on.
4. The project code will be hosted in _private_ repositories within the [CS107 organization](https://code.harvard.edu/CS107). A member of your team must create a private repository named after your team ID (e.g., `team01` for Team 1). After creating the repository, add all team members to it. The teaching staff will have automatic access and do not need to be added.


## Final Deliverables

1. Form a project team and communicate with the teaching staff.
2. Create a private team repository in CS107 organization.
