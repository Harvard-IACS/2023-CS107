You will now begin your final project to develop a Python package for automatic
differentiation. Please get together with your project group and complete the
tasks below for Milestone 1A.

## Steps to complete

1. Find team members you would like to work with and establish a way to
   communicate.
2. Once your team is complete, request a team ID from
   `cs107-staff@g.harvard.edu`.  Your team ID will be `team01` if you
   are team 1 or `team10` if you are team 10 and so on.
3. The project code will be hosted in _private_ repositories in the [CS107
   organization](https://code.harvard.edu/CS107) at `code.harvard.edu`. Once you
   have received your team ID from item 2, a member of your team creates a
   _private_ repository in the CS107 organization at
   <https://code.harvard.edu/CS107> named after your team ID (e.g. `team01` if
   you are team 1) and adds its team members to the repository (you do not need
   to add the teaching staff, we will have access already).

## Final Deliverables

1. Form a project team and request team ID from teaching staff.
2. Create a private team repository in CS107 organization.
