<!--You will read the (**mockup**) contract and identify the key points that you should develop. This will simulate a professional setting, and it is not binding for legal purposes.-->

You are required to review the mockup contract and identify the critical elements that need to be developed. This exercise is designed to emulate a professional environment and is strictly for simulation purposes; it carries no legal obligations.

## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

We expect you and your team to read and understand the SRS. From the SRS, identify the API your library should present.
We expect you and your team to thoroughly read and comprehend the SRS. Based on the SRS, you are to identify the Application Programming Interface (API) that your library is required to provide.

## Steps to complete

1. Every team member must sign the contract and upload the signed document into the root folder of the team's repository.
2. Within your project repository, create a folder named `API_draft`. Inside this folder, provide a README file detailing the modules, classes, and functions planned for inclusion to meet the SRS requirements. Use this phase to outline your pipeline and begin task allocation among team members. Don't try to be overly specific on the details, as this is likely to change as your code evolves.
3. Within the `API_draft` folder, also upload a schematic diagram that illustrates the modules and the API structure your library will present.
