## Submission Instructions

Please update your `milestone1` submission to reflect the feedback given by the
teaching staff. Add a **Feedback** section to your `milestone1` document which
outlines the feedback given and the updates that you made to address the
feedback. One convenient way to organize this would be to create a section
titled **Feedback** and a subsection titled **Milestone 1**. Then, under this
subsection, you can create a list of the individual comments that you received
along with your response on how you addressed each comment. If you receive
feedback on the `README.md` file, please update that document as well.

Your submission should be in the same format as milestone 1:

```
teamXX/
├── docs
│   └── milestone1
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── ...
```
