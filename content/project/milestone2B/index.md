## Submission Instructions

Milestone 2B is a progress report for [Milestone
2]({filename}/project/milestone2/index.md).

Specifically, for each member of the group, please answer the following
questions.

1. What tasks has each group member been assigned to for Milestone 2.
2. What has each group member done since the submission of Milestone 1. 

This progress report should be no longer than 1/2 page (maximum 1 page). Its
main purpose is to help your group structure project work and delegate tasks. We
will be specifically checking to make sure there is equitable distribution of
tasks. All members of the group should contribute code to the core library and
all members should contribute to the documentation.

Your submission should be in the following format:

```
teamXX/
├── docs
│   ├── milestone1
│   └── milestone2_progress
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── ...
```
