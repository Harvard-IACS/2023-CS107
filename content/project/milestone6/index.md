In this **final milestone**, you're tasked with delivering the library as outlined in the Contract.

### Library

Your goal is to publish the first version of your library. Once the documentation is complete, it passes all tests, and every feature is implemented, you can merge it into the main branch. Use this branch to publish the library on Test PyPi.

Each module will be graded and is worth 15 points: six for unit tests, six for implementation, and three for documentation.

All the integration tests must be implemented to check the API you defined (and refined) earlier. If the integration test suite is incomplete, your score will be reduced.

### Tutorials and video

For the final presentation, you need to create a Jupyter notebook that explains your library's functionalities. This includes demonstrating how to execute required functions and handle exceptions.

Upload a video to your repository showing the real-time installation `and` execution of the library. **Every team member must participate**. Feel free to use any VM, virtual environment, or Docker container.

The explanation in the video should not exceed 7 minutes. While there's no strict limit on installation time, please keep it within a reasonable duration.

### Self-evaluation
Each team member must upload an estimate of the hours they dedicated to the project in the `dev` branch to your repo. **These estimates should be submitted via pull requests that are not accepted by you**.

## Final Deliverables
For this milestone, all final deliverables should be uploaded exclusively to the Github page. There's no need to send emails.

1. Publish your library on Test PyPi. Include the link in the `main` branch's README file.
2. A Jupyter notebook that showcases how your library works.
3. Record and upload a video presentation demonstrating the library's installation and functionality.
4. Each team member's self-evaluation of the time spent on the project in the `dev` branch README.
